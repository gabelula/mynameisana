            "To the District Attorneys, and officials within the Department of Justice and TriMet, involved with the case of Ana del Rocio,
            <br><br>
            The recent judgement in the case of Ana del Rocio is correct. A policy of sweeping fare enforcement violate the constitutional rights of transit riders. It is a waste of resources to pursue charges against transit riders for a failure to show proof of fare. Rather than pursue charges against Ana, we the undersigned believe this moment is an opportunity to respond with renewed focus on truly protecting and serving the public. Pursuit of this charge, and others like it, is a waste of public resources. The correct response to this judgement is to accept it. We encourage TriMet to invest in further fare relief, rather than the further militarization or enclosure of public transit infrastructure, or criminalization of transit riders. The DAs and DOJ should let this ruling stand."

              <p>"Ana’s name is Ana, and her name is well known. She is a community leader and has enjoyed a successful political career. A name that only a handful of people know is Rosa Valderrama. For good reason: this name, assigned to Ana at birth, is a painful reminder of a dark time in Ana’s early life. Her legal name has not yet been changed to match the name she uses throughout her life: Ana del Rocío.

                "It's a very Latino thing to have a legal name that's different from the name you go by," del Rocío says. "Ana, the name that my parents had agreed to, was changed unilaterally by my father when I was born. I didn't know this until high school and I couldn't get it changed as a minor because we needed to have both parents' permission. My dad was [gone.] And as an adult, it's really expensive to change your name."
